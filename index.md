### CPSC 120

* Lab 12
 
    Lab 12, part 1 was a very unique and challenging though a very rewarding expierence as we created a colorful animation. Though, the coding was very tedius and somewhat confusing, I was able to grasp the concept of using code from different labs including the use of Loops and Magick Image to complete the Lab. I learned how to write code that creates animations, uses library functions, and generates random numbers.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, Part 1 and Part 2 were extremely fun. In part 1, we created the infamous spell checkers that most websites use(red underlining of mispelled words) using code. Part 2 also consisted of creating a game of guessing a secret number in a file which we got to test out for fun. In this lab I learned about write code that reads and or writes to a file, and handle Input/Output errors.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, using street signs, we created a program to determine parking rules of a parking lot ; commonly used by app systems to administer tickets by police officers or address parking areas for cars. During this lab, we used alot of critical thinking and problem solving skills to make our coding work the way we wanted too, and in the end made it much more rewarding when it was complete. During this lab we learned how to implement defensive programming to wirte a program that validates command line input, and prints a command error when input is invalid, and write if statements with compound Boolean expressions that implement domain logic.
